# unit-4-game


Functionality meets the game's requirements. However it's done in kind of a rushed manner. Originally I included the img tags within the HTML. However doing it that way, I had a very hard time getting the crystal values to pass correctly through the game logic. So I turned to the crystal activity done earlier in class and mirrored it's logic. I wanted to incorporate all the "refresh" mechancics within their own functions and call them after winning/losing. However This caused some unintended issues to crop up.

I'm not very happy with this, however this week was a busy week and I did not get the time to properly code/troubleshoot/style this assignmment.

Need to work on proper time management to give myself ample time to do projects.

After this is graded, I will go back and properly finish this.
